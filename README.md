# 🌍 Zero-Waste DAO: Funding Sustainable Initiatives

Welcome to Zero-Waste DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization built on the Stacks blockchain! This project empowers communities to fund and support zero-waste initiatives worldwide, addressing the real-world crisis of environmental waste and pollution. Token holders propose, vote on, and execute projects like plastic recycling programs, urban composting systems, renewable packaging tech, and education campaigns—democratizing funding for a greener planet.

## ✨ Features

🌱 Submit proposals for zero-waste projects with detailed budgets and impact metrics  
🗳️ Vote on proposals using governance tokens for fair decision-making  
💰 Manage a shared treasury that securely holds and disburses funds  
🔒 Immutable on-chain records of proposals, votes, and fund releases  
🏆 Reward active participants with tokens for successful initiatives  
📊 Track project outcomes with verifiable milestones and reports  
🚫 Prevent spam with token staking requirements for proposals  
🔄 Automated execution of approved proposals via smart contracts  

## 🛠 How It Works

Zero-Waste DAO leverages 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to create a robust, transparent system. Here's a high-level overview of the contracts and their roles:

1. **GovernanceToken.clar**: Manages the ERC-20-like fungible token (ZWD) used for voting power. Includes minting, burning, and transfer functions.  
2. **DAOCore.clar**: The central hub that coordinates proposals, voting periods, and quorum checks. It integrates with other contracts for seamless governance.  
3. **Treasury.clar**: Securely holds DAO funds (STX or SIP-10 tokens) and only releases them upon successful proposal execution.  
4. **ProposalSubmission.clar**: Allows token holders to create proposals with details like description, budget, timelines, and zero-waste impact goals. Requires staking tokens to submit.  
5. **VotingMechanism.clar**: Handles vote casting, delegation, and tallying. Supports weighted voting based on token holdings and prevents double-voting.  
6. **ExecutionEngine.clar**: Automatically triggers fund transfers and milestone verifications once a proposal passes. Integrates with oracles for real-world outcome checks.  
7. **StakingVault.clar**: Manages token staking for proposals and voting boosts, with slashing for malicious behavior.  
8. **RewardsDistributor.clar**: Distributes bonus tokens to proposers and voters of successful initiatives, incentivizing participation.

**For Proposers**  
- Stake ZWD tokens to prove commitment.  
- Call `submit-proposal` in ProposalSubmission.clar with:  
  - Project title and description  
  - Requested funding amount  
  - Expected environmental impact (e.g., tons of waste reduced)  
- If approved, funds are released in stages via ExecutionEngine.clar.  

**For Voters**  
- Hold or delegate ZWD tokens for voting weight.  
- Use `cast-vote` in VotingMechanism.clar during the active period.  
- Monitor proposals via DAOCore.clar queries like `get-proposal-details`.  

**For Fund Managers/Verifiers**  
- Query Treasury.clar for balance and transaction history.  
- Verify outcomes with `check-milestone` in ExecutionEngine.clar for transparency.  

That's it! Join the DAO, propose ideas, and vote to make zero-waste a reality— all powered by blockchain for trustless, global collaboration.
